# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions for the [advent of code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/). I decided to work in `python` due to

- Fast to test/develop
- Need to improve my python skills

I give no guarantee that these solutions are fast/efficient/pretty. They should just work (hopefully).
